get-started-to-use-function-calling
===

This is a sample program to use function calling API of OpenAI API. In this sample, we create a feature flag has boolean value on CloudWatch Evidently with natural language.

## Reference

- [Function calling | GPT - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)
- [Chat | API Reference - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)

## Prepare

Create virtual environment and install requirements.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv \
&& source .venv/bin/activate \
&& pip install pip --upgrade \
&& pip install -r requirements.lock
```

âš  The permission to create project and feature on CloudWatch Evidently is required.

## Usage

```bash
python -m main
```

```bash
What do you want to create a feature? >
```

Input a project name, feature name and other information you want to create. For example:

```bash
I want to create a feature that determines if sushi is served or not. The name of the feature is sushi and the project name is food-project. If entity id is force-sushi, this feature's value will be true.
```

```bash

--------------------
Created project food-project with ARN arn:aws:evidently:ap-northeast-1:000000000000:project/food-project
Created feature sushi with ARN arn:aws:evidently:ap-northeast-1:000000000000:project/food-project/feature/sushi

-------Response-------
created a feature info

    Project: food-project
    Feature: sushi

    Check the feature on CloudWatch Evidently using following command:

    aws evidently get-feature --project 'food-project' --feature 'sushi'
```

Check the feature on CloudWatch Evidently.

```bash
$ aws evidently get-feature --project 'food-project' --feature 'sushi'
